# Phone-Directory-Application-of-JUNIT-MOCKITO-
A phone directory using a doubly linked list enables efficient searching and sorting of contact details by first name, last name, or partial matches. It stores comprehensive contact information, including names, phone numbers, addresses, emails, and websites, minimizing errors in manual processes. This system facilitates editing, updating, and searching of contact data, providing a dependable, user-friendly, and secure solution. Access to alter and update information is restricted to the admin, ensuring high-level security. Transitioning from manual systems, it streamlines operations, reducing paperwork and meeting modern standards. Overall, it's an automated, efficient, and reliable solution for contact management.

Additionally, rigorous testing was performed using JUnit and Mockito. Utilizing annotations like `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, and `@Test`, comprehensive tests were conducted on critical functionalities. These included `testInsert`, `testDisplay`, `testUpdate`, `testSearchByName`, `testSearchByNumber`, and `testSearchByGmail`. These tests ensured accurate insertion of contacts, seamless display of directory contents, successful updating of contact details, and effective searching by name, number, and email. With each test, the system's robustness and reliability were validated, ensuring that it meets the expected standards of functionality and performance.
